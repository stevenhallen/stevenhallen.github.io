We have been consulting a state agency in their move toward a more agile software development process.  This is the second time we’ve helped a state agency with the transition from requirements focused, big design up front (BDUF), to a more lean and responsive development process.

The client has been very happy and excited with all the positive changes implemented over the past several months.  *BDD is a hit* as well as automated full stack testing, however some agile practices, such as velocity based planning, have been less accepted.

Let’s look into what’s behind this difference in acceptance of the various agile practices.

===Agile, What is it?

From the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/).

* Individuals and personal interactions
* Working software
* Customer collaboration
* Rapid response to change

Using that as the guiding force, the following detailed practices were part of our implementation of agile at this state agency.  Some were readily accepted, some are taking a bit longer to implement.

===Agile Practices Readily Accepted

* User Stories
* Short Iterations
* Daily Standup
* “Requirements” written as user stories
* User stories written in Gherkin format
* Automated builds
* Automated testing

===Agile Practices Less Accepted

* Daily customer collaboration
* Velocity based project planning
* Programmer assignments based on story priority

When looking at the practices that were accepted and not as well accepted, it’s clear that those practices that involved people *outside the development team* had a *lower chance* of being readily accepted.  This is to be expected. Since most developers are well aware of the problems with traditional waterfall methods, they are quick to jump on the “agile train”.

This fact reminded me of Steven Covey’s _Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_. In his first habit, *Be Proactive*, he mentions two circles.  The circle of concern and the circle of influence.

Covey talks about focusing on the circle of influence, and how successful people are able to utilize their success to *grow their circle of influence*.

And it’s this habit that I think is important for implementing agile within an organization where the top management is not leading the charge.  By focusing our changes on those things most controlled by the developers, we were able to improve the internal processes quickly.  We could have battled management on the futility of multi-month detailed project plans, but that would likely not have helped them see the benefits of agile.  We needed to *first prove Agile Development is better, and after that, grow the circle of influence*.

> Successful people are able to utilize their success to grow their circle of influence

Agile, like many process improvement approaches is *not an all or nothing affair*.  This is an important part of any organizational change strategy and moving to agile software development practices is no different.  At this state agency we were able to convert to BDD based user stories, with full stack automated integration tests, more frequent meetings with the customers, and less up front documentation.  *That’s a success*.  The development team still needs to create detailed estimates and multi-month project plans for management as they have yet to buy in to anything different.  But this is the first year of a *multi-year change* and with enough success within the development team, they’ll be able to grow their circle of influence toward management, and perhaps change the way managers manage IT projects at a high level.  Time will tell.
